/*

Values that `calc()` function can support:
  -number,
  -lenght,
  -frequency,
  -angle,
  -time,
  -percentage,

*/

/* We can controle the mathematical order of operation by using () or [].((2 + 3) * 4) */

/* We can use calc() fonction to convert one type of unit to another type of unit but we can combine them in one calc() fonction.
*/

/* If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, we have to divided the value with unit to 1unit.*/

/* *plus* and *minus* operators inside the function need spaces around them because If we do not put space the brower consider the plus and minus as the sing value of the calc. */

/* The way that we can convert a value into a negative value:
  -first we have to set the width of element into 100vw,
  -then we have to set negative half of the viewport width plus half the width of the element used. */

/*
  Can the `calc()` function work with colour values? e.g. a light red plus a light red should equal a darker red. Yes It can.
