  Questions
  =======================

  - What is the difference between `opacity` and a `background-color` that is semi-transparent?
  - What is the difference between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`?
  - Why would we use `visibility: visible;`?

*/

/* The different between 'opacity' and a 'background-color' is 'opacity' has value limited 0-1 and it is already property which define transparancy whereas, background-color` that is semi-transparent property value. */

/* The different between 'display: none' and 'visibility: hidden' display-none'; with display: none an element behaves like it is completely deleted you can not see the structure in HTML,
However, visibility: hidden doesnâ€™t remove an element completely. It just makes the element invisible */

/* We use visibility : visible because the element visibility has an element existe  */
